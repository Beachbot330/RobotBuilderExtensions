# RobotBuilderExtensions

Extensions for Robot Builder used by FRC Team 330 (BeachBot). 
The extensions should be placed in C:\Users\<User>\Robotbuilder\extensions\

For the most part, the extensions only export to Java.
The .java files in the extensions are not needed for RobotBuilder, 
but are Java class for the object being exported and should be added to your robot project
