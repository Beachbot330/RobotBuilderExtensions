# RobotBuilderExtensions

Extensions for Robot Builder used by FRC Team 330 (BeachBot). 
The extensions should be placed in C:\Users\\\<User>\Robotbuilder\extensions\

For the most part, the extensions only export to Java. They require the use of BeachbotLib

The CTRE extensions are overriden. After installing the Phoenix framework, it is necessary to
reinstall these extensions.
